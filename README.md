# AV1 Decoder

## Why?
To lose what is left of my fleeting sanity

Implementing AV1 is a more ambitious project with a clear defined goal.
The existing testdata creates a solid foundation to program against,
and I hope to improve my math/algorithm skills through the project.

## How?

Using testdata to slowly build stuff up, then fix whatever doesn't work.

Testdata: https://aomedia.org/av1-video-decoder-verification-tool/ 

Also not going to consider speed till it conforms to all tests.

## Spec
https://aomediacodec.github.io/av1-spec/av1-spec.pdf



## Notes

Mv = Motion Vector (implement struct for that?)

Variables starting with an upper case letter are derived for the decoding of the current syntax
structure and all depending syntax structures
